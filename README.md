# Checkpoint 1: SQL Analytics

### How to run our queries

* Clone our directory (in a location you will remember) using `git clone insert_link_here`
* Open your terminal, navigate to the directory you just cloned. Then cd into the src folder
* For **q1_a**, un the following command: `psql -f q1_a.sql -h cpdb.cgod7egsd6vr.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com -U cpdb-student -d cpdb -p 5432`
    - If you are prompted for a password, enter the following: ***datasci4lyf**
    - If typing the password in doesn't work, try to copy-and-paste it
* Repeat the above steps for each of our questions, replacing **q1_a.sql** with the corresponding file name. Here is a complete list of our SQL files that need to be executed:
    - q_1a
    - q_1b
    - q_1c
    - q_2
    - q_3
    - q_4
